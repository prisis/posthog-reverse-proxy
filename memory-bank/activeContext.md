# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

- Finalizing `README.md` with additional user-provided context on the reasons for using a reverse proxy.
- Ensuring Memory Bank is fully updated.

## Recent Changes

- Created all core Memory Bank files.
- Created the `index.html` file.
- Significantly updated `README.md` with detailed PostHog Netlify proxy setup instructions.
- Further expanded the "Why Use a Reverse Proxy for PostHog?" section in `README.md` with user's specific reasoning and cost considerations.

## Next Steps

- Project is in a good state with comprehensive documentation. Further steps would involve actual deployment, testing with live PostHog project keys, and monitoring.
- Consider creating `.cursorrules` if specific project patterns or preferences are identified during further work.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- `README.md` is now the primary source of setup instructions and rationale for this project, incorporating user feedback.
- The provided `netlify.toml` in the project uses EU endpoints, which is consistent with the notes in the updated `README.md`.
