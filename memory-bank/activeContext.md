# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

- Initial project setup.
- Creation of a dummy `index.html` file as requested.
- Establishment of the Memory Bank.

## Recent Changes

- Created `memory-bank/projectbrief.md`.
- Created `memory-bank/productContext.md`.

## Next Steps

- Create `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`.
- Create `memory-bank/techContext.md`.
- Create `memory-bank/progress.md`.
- Create the `index.html` file with content advertising anolilab.com.
- Plan the Netlify reverse proxy configuration.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- The `index.html` will be very basic, as per the request for a "dummy" page.
