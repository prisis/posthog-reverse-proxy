# Progress

## What Works

- Initial Memory Bank structure created and consistently updated.
- Dummy `index.html` created and advertising anolilab.com.
- `README.md` has been comprehensively updated with a step-by-step guide for setting up the Netlify reverse proxy for PostHog, incorporating user-provided details and best practices.
- `netlify.toml` in the project is configured for EU PostHog endpoints, aligning with documentation.

## What's Left to Build

- `.cursorrules` file if any specific project patterns or preferences are identified during further work or testing.
- Potentially, more advanced proxy configurations if specific needs arise (e.g., proxying PostHog UI).

## Current Status

- **Phase 1: Initial Setup & Documentation (Completed)**
    - Memory Bank files created and updated throughout the process.
    - `index.html` created.
    - `README.md` created and refined with comprehensive setup instructions.
    - `netlify.toml` reviewed and aligns with documentation.

## Known Issues

- None at this stage. The setup relies on external services (Netlify, DNS provider, PostHog) behaving as expected.
