# Tech Context

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** For the `index.html` landing page.
- **Netlify:** For hosting the static site and for reverse proxy functionality.
    - Netlify configuration (either `_redirects` file or `netlify.toml`).
- **PostHog:** The service being proxied (details of the specific instance to be provided/configured).

## Development Setup

- A simple text editor for HTML.
- Netlify CLI (optional, for local testing) or direct deployment to Netlify.

## Technical Constraints

- Dependent on Netlify's proxy capabilities and limitations.
- The `index.html` should be lightweight and static.

## Dependencies

- None beyond standard web technologies and Netlify platform features.
